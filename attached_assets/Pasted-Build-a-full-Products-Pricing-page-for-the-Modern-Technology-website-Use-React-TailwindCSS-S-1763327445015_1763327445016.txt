Build a full “Products & Pricing” page for the Modern Technology website.
Use React + TailwindCSS. Style should be futuristic, clean, neon-accented (blue/purple/teal), and mobile-responsive. Include animations, hover effects, and tooltip popovers (question mark icons) that show feature descriptions.

PAGE STRUCTURE
1. Header Section

Title: “AI Products & Bundles”

Subtitle: “Choose the automation level that fits your business.”

Animated gradient background

Clean glowing divider

2. Pricing Toggle

Create a top-level pricing toggle:

Toggle between Monthly vs Yearly (Save 25%)

Monthly pricing:

Basic: $1,000 / month

Advanced: $2,250 / month

Suite: $3,250 / month

Yearly pricing:

Basic: $750 / month (billed annually)

Advanced: $1,800 / month (billed annually)

Suite: $2,700 / month (billed annually)

Make the toggle visually animated with smooth transitions.

3. Tier Cards (Side-By-Side)

Create three pricing/product cards: Basic, Advanced, Suite.
Each card should show price based on toggle state, feature list, and a CTA button.

4. Component Requirements

Use modular components: PricingToggle.jsx, TierCard.jsx, Tooltip.jsx, FeatureList.jsx

Tooltip should be a small question-mark icon (“?”) that on hover shows a floating description box with a fade-in animation.

Card hover animation: slight scale + glowing neon outline.

CTA Buttons for each tier:

Basic: “Start Basic”

Advanced: “Upgrade to Advanced”

Suite: “Go Full Automation”
